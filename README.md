# File Reader and Writer Script

This Python script performs basic file input/output (I/O) operations.

## Task 1: Read from a File

- Attempts to open and read the contents of a file named `sample.txt`.
- If the file is not found, it displays an error message.

## Task 2: Write and Append to a File

- Prompts the user to enter text and writes it to `output.txt`.
- Then asks for additional text to append to the same file.
- Finally, displays the full content of `output.txt`.

## Files Used

- `sample.txt` — Input file (must exist for Task 1 to work).
- `output.txt` — Created or modified during Task 2.
